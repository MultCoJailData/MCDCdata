# Conflict Plan

1. Phrase in positives - non judgemental (focus on you and your needs) (non-violent communication)

1. If tensions arise between two individuals that are affecting the group, those involved should first discuss the problems individually or find a rubber duck to vent to. 
-If after venting there is group agreement that a problem needs to be discussed, the group can discuss it with the individual -Try to bring up issues from a place of empathy. Ask what support the individual needs. 
-If the problem persists, the group will speak to the instructional team.
